(All such services are referred to collectively herein as "Lookin For It.") By accessing or using Lookin For It, you are a "user" and you accept and agree to the terms below (the "Terms of Use" or "TOU") as a legal contract between you and LFI. The TOU include and incorporate additional terms ("guidelines") applicable to particular categories or services available on Lookin For It as set forth to users upon access to such categories or services. LFI may post changes to the TOU at any time, and any such changes will be applicable to all subsequent access to or use of Lookin For It.

</br></br>
If you do not accept and agree to all provisions of the TOU, now or in the future, you may reject the TOU by immediately terminating all access and use of Lookin For It, in which case any continuing access or use of Lookin For It is unauthorized.

</br></br>
You are also required to comply with, and to ensure compliance with, all laws, ordinances and regulations applicable to your activities on Lookin For It.

</br></br>
Lookin For It is intended and designed for users 18 years of age and older, and access or use by anyone younger is not authorized.

</br></br>
The TOU grant you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive license to access Lookin For It and use Lookin For It, in whole or in part, including but not limited to LFI intellectual property therein, solely in compliance with the TOU.

</br></br>
"LOOKIN FOR IT" and  “LFI” are trademarks of LFI and are protected by United States and international laws. The TOU do not authorize you to use "LOOKIN FOR IT,"  “LFI” or any similar or related marks for any use pertaining to classified advertising, Internet advertising, social networks, online forums, online communication services or any similar or related use, or any other use that is likely to cause confusion on the part of, to cause mistake by or to deceive the public as to any affiliation, connection, association, origin, sponsorship, approval or endorsement by or with LFI.

</br></br>
2. MODERATION

</br></br>
CL has the right, but not the obligation, to regulate content (which includes but is not limited to postings, text, code, images, video, binary files, ads, accounts, account information, flags, emails, messages and any other user communications ("content")) posted to, stored on or transmitted via Lookin For It by any user (or any other third party in any manner); to regulate conduct (including but not limited to any authorized or unauthorized access to or use of Lookin For It) by any user (or any other third party in any manner); and to enforce the TOU, for any reason and in any manner or by any means that LFI, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or appropriate (including but not limited to automated and manual screening, blocking, filtering, exclusion from index pages, exclusion from search results, requiring the use of an application programming interface (API), requiring the use of a bulk posting interface, authorization, verification, and the deletion and/or termination of content, accounts and/or all or any use or access). LFI may, in its sole discretion and without notice, start, stop or modify any regulation or enforcement measures at any time. LFI action or inaction to regulate content or conduct or to enforce against any potential violation of the TOU by any user (or any other third party) does not waive LFI's right to implement or not implement regulation or enforcement measures with respect to any subsequent or similar content, conduct or potential TOU violation.

</br></br>
You also understand and agree that any action or inaction by LFI or any of its directors, officers, stockholders, employees, consultants, agents or representatives (collectively, "LFI Representatives") to prevent, restrict, redress or regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential TOU violation is undertaken voluntarily and in good faith, and you expressly agree that neither LFI nor any LFI Representative shall be liable to you or anyone else for any action or inaction to prevent, restrict, redress, or regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential violation of the TOU.

</br></br>
Although LFI Representatives may moderate content, conduct and TOU compliance on Lookin For It at LFI's discretion, LFI Representatives have no authority to make binding commitments, promises or representations to anyone that they or anyone else on behalf of LFI will "take care" of any alleged problem or complaint, or that they or anyone else on behalf of LFI will otherwise stop, cure or prevent any problem, content, conduct or purported TOU violation from occurring or recurring. Accordingly, you further agree that any representation (written or verbal) by any LFI Representative (or by anyone else acting on behalf of LFI or by anyone purportedly acting on behalf of LFI) that LFI (including but not limited to any LFI Representative, anyone else acting on behalf of LFI, or anyone purportedly acting on behalf of LFI) would or would not prevent, restrict, redress or regulate content (including, without limitation, screen, block, moderate, review, remove, terminate, delete, edit or otherwise stop, cure or exclude any content), or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential or purported TOU violation is superseded by this provision and is nonbinding and unenforceable. Specifically, you agree that LFI, LFI Representatives and anyone else authorized to act on behalf of LFI shall in no circumstance be liable as a result of any representation that LFI, a LFI Representative or anyone else on behalf of LFI would or would not restrict or redress any content, conduct or potential or purported TOU violation. This paragraph may not be modified, waived or released except by a written agreement, dated and signed by LFI's Chief Executive Officer and dated and signed by the individual or entity to whom the modification, waiver or release is granted.

</br></br>
LFI also has the right in its sole discretion to limit, modify, interrupt, suspend or discontinue all or any portions of Lookin For It at any time without notice. LFI and LFI Representatives shall not be liable for any such limitations, modifications, interruptions, suspensions or discontinuance, or any purported losses, harm or damages arising from or related thereto.

</br></br>
4. POSTING AND ACCOUNTS

</br></br>
This section 4 applies to all uses and users of Lookin For It, unless LFI has specifically authorized an exception to a particular term for a particular user in a written agreement. LFI has sole and absolute discretion to authorize or deny any exception or exceptions to the terms in this section 4.

</br></br>
a. Postings

</br></br>
Lookin For It is intended and designed as a local service. A user may post content only to the single specific geographic area offered on Lookin For It (see http://www.Lookin For It.org/about/sites) for which that content is most relevant. The same or substantially similar content (for example, an ad for a particular item or service, a particular offer, a particular message or a particular comment) may not be posted to or communicated via more than one such geographic area. Content that is equally relevant to multiple (i.e., more than one) geographic areas should not be posted on Lookin For It.

</br></br>
The same or substantially similar content may not be posted in more than one Lookin For It category. A user may post content only in the single Lookin For It category to which it is most relevant, and must not post content to inappropriate categories. For example, content advertising classes or vocational training must be posted under the "classes" category of the "community" section and may not be posted in any "jobs" category. Likewise, content advertising auto financing must be posted under the "financial" category of the "services" sections and not under "cars/trucks" category in the "for sale" section. Similarly, services relating to real estate must be posted under "real estate" category of the "services" section and may not be posted to any category within the "housing" section.

</br></br>
A user may post the same or substantially similar content no more than once every 48 hours.

</br></br>
Where a Lookin For It category provides specific subcategories for posts by particular types of users (e.g., car sales "by-owners" versus "by-dealers," and real estate for sale "by-owner" versus "by-broker"), a user may post content only in the single user sub-category most accurate for that user. In particular, no user acting as a broker, agent or dealer may post in any "by owner" category.

</br></br>
Users may not circumvent any technological measure implemented by LFI to restrict the manner in which content may be posted on Lookin For It or to regulate the manner in which content (including but not limited to email) may be transmitted to other users. This prohibition includes, without limitation, a ban on the use of multiple email addresses (created via an email address generator or otherwise); the use of multiple IP addresses (via proxy servers, modem toggling, or otherwise); CAPTCHA circumvention, automation or outsourcing; multiple and/or fraudulent Lookin For It accounts, including phone-verified accounts; URL shortening, obfuscation or redirection; use of multiple phone lines or phone forwarding for verification; and content obfuscation via HTML techniques, printing text on images, inserting random text or content "spinning."

</br></br>
It is expressly prohibited for any third party to post content to Lookin For It on behalf of another. Users must post content only on their own behalf, and may not permit, enable, induce or encourage any third party to post content for them.

</br></br>
It is expressly prohibited to post content to Lookin For It using any automated means. Users must post all content personally and manually through all steps of the posting process. It is also expressly prohibited for any user to develop, offer, market, sell, distribute or provide an automated means to perform any step of the posting process (in whole or in part). Any user who develops, offers, markets, sells, distributes or provides an automated means to perform any step of the posting process (in whole or in part) shall be responsible and liable to LFI for each instance of access to Lookin For It (by any user or other third party) using that automated means.

</br></br>
Affiliate marketing is expressly prohibited on Lookin For It. Users may not post content or communicate with any Lookin For It user for purposes of affiliate marketing or in connection with any affiliate marketing system, scheme or program in any manner or under any circumstance.

</br></br>
b. Accounts

</br></br>
A user may maintain and use no more than one account, including a telephone or phone-verified account ("PVA"), to post content. A user specifically may not create or use additional accounts for the purpose of circumventing technological restrictions (security measures) in the posting process or otherwise for posting content in violation of the TOU.

</br></br>
A user may create an account, including a PVA, only on his/her own behalf. A user must not permit, enable, induce or encourage others to create accounts or PVAs for him/her. The creation of accounts or PVAs for others is expressly prohibited.

</br></br>
A user must only use his/her own account or PVA, and may not use any account or PVA of another.

</br></br>
The purchase and sale of accounts, including but not limited to PVAs, is expressly prohibited.

</br></br>
A user must create his/her account or PVA personally and manually and may not create accounts or PVAs by any automated means. Without limitation, this includes the obligation that the user personally and manually solves any CAPTCHA challenge in the account creation process. Further, a user must create any PVA using his/her own valid telephone number. The creation of a PVA using a telephone number that is not the user's own, a telephonic forwarding service or system, or a temporary/disposable telephone number or service is expressly prohibited. The circumvention of any technological restriction or security measure in the account creation or PVA creation process is also expressly prohibited.

</br></br>
c. Flagging

</br></br>
A user shall not "flag" (or otherwise seek removal of) content on Lookin For It without a personal, good-faith belief that the content violates the TOU. A user may flag content only on his/her own behalf. A user must not permit, enable, induce or encourage others to flag content for them. A user must not flag content for others.

</br></br>
A user may flag a specific item of content only once.

</br></br>
A user flagging content must do so manually and may not employ any automated means, products (including, without limitation, software programs) or services to flag content. A user must not circumvent any technological restrictions (security measures) in the flagging process. Without limitation, this prohibition includes a ban on the use of multiple IP addresses for flagging (by use of proxy servers or any means whatsoever).

</br></br>
5. UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS AND ACTIVITIES

</br></br>
This section 5 applies to all uses and users of Lookin For It, unless LFI has specifically authorized an exception to a particular term for a particular user in a written agreement. LFI has sole and absolute discretion to authorize or deny any exception or exceptions to the terms in this section 5.

</br></br>
To maintain the integrity and functionality of Lookin For It for its users, access to Lookin For It and/or activities related to Lookin For It that are harmful to, inconsistent with or disruptive of Lookin For It and/or its users' beneficial use and enjoyment of Lookin For It are expressly unauthorized and prohibited. For example, without limitation:

</br></br>
The collection of Lookin For It users' personal information (including but not limited to email addresses, IP addresses and telephone numbers) is not allowed for any purpose.

</br></br>
Any copying, aggregation, display, distribution, performance or derivative use of Lookin For It or any content posted on Lookin For It whether done directly or through intermediaries (including but not limited to by means of spiders, robots, crawlers, scrapers, framing, iframes or RSS feeds) is prohibited. As a limited exception, general purpose Internet search engines and noncommercial public archives will be entitled to access Lookin For It without individual written agreements executed with LFI that specifically authorize an exception to this prohibition if, in all cases and individual instances: (a) they provide a direct hyperlink to the relevant Lookin For It website, service, forum or content; (b) they access Lookin For It from a stable IP address using an easily identifiable agent; and (c) they comply with LFI's robots.txt file; provided however, that LFI may terminate this limited exception as to any search engine or public archive (or any person or entity relying on this provision to access Lookin For It without their own written agreement executed with LFI), at any time and in its sole discretion, upon written notice, including, without limitation, by email notice.

</br></br>
Any access to or use of Lookin For It to design, develop, test, update, operate, modify, maintain, support, market, advertise, distribute or otherwise make available any program, application or service (including, without limitation, any device, technology, product, computer program, mobile device application, website, or mechanical or personal service) that enables or provides access to, use of, operation of or interoperation with Lookin For It (including, without limitation, to access content, post content, cross-post content, re-post content, respond or reply to content, verify content, transmit content, create accounts, verify accounts, use accounts, circumvent and/or automate technological security measures or restrictions, or flag content) is prohibited. This prohibition specifically applies but is not limited to software, programs, applications and services for use or operation on or by any computer and/or any electronic, wireless and/or mobile device, technology or product that exists now or in the future.

</br></br>
If you access Lookin For It or copy, display, distribute, perform or create derivative works from Lookin For It webpages or other LFI intellectual property in violation of the TOU or for purposes inconsistent with the TOU, your access, copying, display, distribution, performance or derivative work is unauthorized. Circumvention of any technological restriction or security measure on Lookin For It or any provision of the TOU that restricts content, conduct, accounts or access is expressly prohibited. For purposes of this paragraph, you agree that cached copies of Lookin For It webpages on your computer or computer server constitute "copies" under the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101. For purposes of this paragraph, you further agree that CAPTCHAs and telephone verification are "technological measures" that effectively control access to copyright-protected components and rights of LFI pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 1201.

</br></br>
Any effort to decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer all or any part of Lookin For It in order to identify, acquire, copy or emulate any source code or object code is expressly prohibited.

</br></br>
Any activities (including but not limited to posting voluminous content) that are inconsistent with use of Lookin For It in compliance with the TOU or that may impair or interfere with the integrity, functionality, performance, usefulness, usability, signal-to-noise ratio or quality of all or any part of Lookin For It in any manner are expressly prohibited.

</br></br>
Any attempt (whether or not successful) to engage in, or to enable, induce, encourage, cause or assist anyone else to engage in, any of the above unauthorized and prohibited access and activities is also expressly prohibited and is a violation of the TOU.

</br></br>
6. USER COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSACTIONS, INTERACTIONS, DISPUTES AND RELATIONS

</br></br>
LFI and LFI Representatives are not parties to, have no involvement or interest in, make no representations or warranties as to, and have no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other user, person or organization ("your interactions with others"). You must conduct any necessary, appropriate, prudent or judicious investigation, inquiry, research or due diligence with respect to your interactions with others.

</br></br>
You agree to indemnify and hold LFI and LFI Representatives harmless from and against any third-party claim, cause of action, demand or damages related to or arising out of your interactions with others. This indemnification obligation includes payment of any attorneys' fees and costs incurred by LFI or LFI Representatives.

</br></br>
7. FEES

</br></br>
LFI may charge a fee to post content or for other features, products, services or licenses. You are responsible to LFI for any fees applicable to content that you post or other features, products, services or licenses you purchase or that are purchased through your account. You authorize LFI, or its designated payment processor, to charge your specified credit card, debit card or other payment method for such fees.

</br></br>
Unless otherwise specified, all fees are in United States dollars and all charges will be made in United States dollars. Any applicable sales or other taxes are additional to the stated fee. Currency exchange settlements and foreign transaction fees are based on your agreement with your credit card or other payment method provider.

</br></br>
Except as required by law, all fees are nonrefundable, including, without limitation, in situations where paid posts are removed by LFI or by community flagging. Payments and purchases may not be canceled by the user, except as required by law. However, LFI reserves the right to refuse or terminate any purchase or attempted purchase at any time in its sole discretion. You understand and agree that if you authorize a payment transaction with your credit card, debit card or other payment method, but your charge is rejected for any reason, there may be a hold on your use of that transaction amount for several days.

</br></br>
11. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

</br></br>
You acknowledge and agree that any violation or breach of the TOU may cause LFI immediate and irreparable harm and damages; consequently, notwithstanding any other provision of the TOU or other applicable legal requirements, LFI has the right to, and may in its discretion, immediately obtain preliminary injunctive relief (including, without limitation, temporary restraining orders) and seek permanent injunctive relief regarding any violation or breach of the TOU. In addition to any and all other remedies available to LFI in law or in equity, LFI may seek specific performance of any term in the TOU, including but not limited to by preliminary or permanent injunction.

Consequently, for such TOU violations, you agree to pay liquidated damages to LFI as described in the following schedule:

</br></br>
http://www.Lookin For It.org/about/liquidated.damages

</br></br>
Furthermore you agree that the amounts of liquidated damages described therein are reasonable estimates of LFI's damages for such violations, and that liquidated damages for violations of the TOU are and will be cumulative.

</br></br>
Any and all LFIaims, causes of action or disputes (regardless of theory) between you and LFI arising out of or related to the TOU, Lookin For It or content accessed through Lookin For It shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict or choice of law principles.
